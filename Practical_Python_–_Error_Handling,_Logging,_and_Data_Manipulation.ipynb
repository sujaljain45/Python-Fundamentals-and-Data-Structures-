        "Multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process. All threads share the same memory space, which makes communication between threads faster. However, due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multithreading is not very effective for CPU-bound tasks but works well for I/O-bound tasks such as file handling and network operations.\n",
